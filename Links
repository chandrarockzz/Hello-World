removing init scripts
5.19.1. Using systemd ExclusivelyÂ¶

Set the these variables in your distribution configuration file as follows:

     DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " systemd"
     VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_init_manager = "systemd"
                

You can also prevent the SysVinit distribution feature from being automatically enabled as follows:

     DISTRO_FEATURES_BACKFILL_CONSIDERED = "sysvinit"
                

Doing so removes any redundant SysVinit scripts.

To remove initscripts from your image altogether, set this variable also:

     VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_initscripts = ""
